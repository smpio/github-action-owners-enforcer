# owners-enforcer

> Giving staging and master branch, the app will push commits from the staging to the master if original pusher is in the OWNERS file.

DEPRECATED! Use [github-app-owners-enforcer](https://github.com/smpio/github-app-owners-enforcer) instead.

Github action is not the case, because unpaid Github accounts can't use branch protection and `github-actions[bot]`
can't be added as exclusion to protection rules.
